Abstract
This project aims to develop a robust data preprocessing, transformation, and loading pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn. The pipeline is designed to handle real-world datasets with missing values, outliers, and a mix of categorical and numerical data. By standardizing and scaling data, encoding categorical variables, and splitting datasets into training and testing sets, the pipeline facilitates accurate and efficient machine learning model development. The result is a reusable framework for preparing data for predictive analytics and advanced modeling tasks.

Overview of the Pipeline
The pipeline consists of five main stages:

Data Loading:

Input: Raw dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel).
Output: A Pandas DataFrame containing the dataset for processing.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (imputation or deletion).
Encode categorical features.
Detect and remove outliers.
Feature Transformation:

Scale numeric features for uniformity.
Create new features to enhance model performance.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.
Data Export:

Save the preprocessed data for use in machine learning workflows.
